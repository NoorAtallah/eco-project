Eco-Action Tracker: Book Exchange and Events
Project Overview
Eco-Action Tracker is a collaborative platform aimed at promoting eco-friendly habits by encouraging users to engage in sustainable activities, exchange books, and participate in eco-events. Our platform caters to individuals, businesses, and communities, providing tools to track environmental impact and build a collective eco-conscious community.

Instead of traditional eco-challenges, our team introduced an innovative book exchange feature, allowing users to share, swap, and discuss eco-related books. We also focus on eco-events, where users can organize and participate in activities like tree-planting, clean-up drives, and educational webinars.
